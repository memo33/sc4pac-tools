# The following section describes an asset.
# An asset is a file that can be downloaded from the file exchanges.
# An asset cannot be installed directly, but it can provide files for one or multiple installable packages.

assetId: "memo-testing-file-d-zip"  # A unique identifier (lowercase, hyphenated, no special characters)
# The version string and lastModified timestamp are used to determine when an
# asset has changed, so that all packages depending on it can be reinstalled.
version: "1.0-1"  # increment the -1 patch version if the remote file is updated without incrementing the version
lastModified: "2023-07-29T21:33:57Z"
# The direct download link to the artifact (supports zip files, jar files, and jar files containd in zip files)

# The following section describes a package.
# Packages are collections of files that can be installed on user request.
# They only store metadata that tells sc4pac where to obtain the files and how to install them.
# The files are extracted from assets.
# Packages can depend on any number of other packages ("dependencies").

group: "memo"  # Package owner or modding group (lowercase, hyphenated, no special characters)
name: "package-template-basic"  # The name of the package, unique within the group (lowercase, hyphenated, no special characters)
# The unique identifier of a package is <group>:<name>
version: "2.0"
subfolder: "100-props-textures"  # The folder inside Plugins to which the package is installed (even 3-digit number prefix to control load order)

dependencies:  # Optional list of package identifiers (zero or more)
- "memo:package-template-variants"

assets:  # Optional list of assets from which to extract files (zero or more)
- assetId: "memo-testing-file-d-zip"
  # Optional RegEx include patterns matched against the path inside the archive
  # (starting with and separated by _forward_ slashes for platform independence).
  # The matching is case-insensitive for file-system independence.
  # By default, every file is included.
  include:
  - "/folder/file1.dat"
  - "/folder2/"
  - "/file3.*"
  - "^/full/path/to/file4\\.dat$"
  # Optional RegEx exclude patterns tested after includes.
  # If absent or empty, then by default all file types other than .dat/.sc4model/.sc4lot/.sc4desc/.sc4 are excluded.
  exclude: []

# Additional descriptive information, entirely optional.
