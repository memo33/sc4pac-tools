# Command-line interface

The *sc4pac* CLI is a non-graphical alternative interface for the terminal.
For most uses, it is recommended to use the *sc4pac* GUI instead.


## Overview

- Prerequisites:
  - Java 11+ ([Windows]/[macOS]/[Linux], see [Adoptium] for details)
  - Mono ([macOS](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/)/[Linux](https://repology.org/project/mono/versions), not needed on Windows)
  - Enough disk space

  [Adoptium]: https://adoptium.net/installation/
  [Windows]: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=windows&package=jre
  [macOS]: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=mac&package=jre
  [Linux]: https://repology.org/project/openjdk/versions

- [Download the latest release of the sc4pac CLI](https://github.com/memo33/sc4pac-tools/releases/latest)
  and extract the contents to any location in your user directory (for example, your Desktop).
- Open a shell in the new directory (e.g. on Windows, open the folder and type `cmd` in the address bar of the explorer window)
  and run the command-line tool `sc4pac` by calling:
  - `sc4pac` in Windows cmd.exe
  - `.\sc4pac` in Windows PowerShell
  - `./sc4pac` on Linux or macOS

  If everything works, this displays a help message.
- Install your first package [cyclone-boom:save-warning](https://memo33.github.io/sc4pac/channel/?pkg=cyclone-boom:save-warning):
  - `sc4pac add cyclone-boom:save-warning`
  - `sc4pac update`
- Be aware that Simtropolis has a download limit of 20 files per day.
  If you reach the limit, configure your
  [personal Simtropolis token](https://github.com/memo33/sc4pac-tools/blob/main/src/scripts/sc4pac.bat#L13-L23)
  for authentication.
  Alternatively, simply continue the installation process the next day.
- Install other [available packages](https://memo33.github.io/sc4pac/#/packages).

## add

**Usage:** `sc4pac add [packages...]`

Add new packages to install explicitly.

Afterwards, run `sc4pac update` for the changes to take effect.

**Example:**
```sh
sc4pac add cyclone-boom:save-warning
```

Package names are of the form `<group>:<package-name>`.


---
## update

**Usage:** `sc4pac update [options]`

Update all installed packages to their latest version and install any missing packages.

In particular, this installs the explicitly added packages and, implicitly, all their dependencies.

**Example:**
```sh
sc4pac update
```

**Options:**
- `-y, --yes` Accept some default answers without asking, usually "yes"


---
## remove

**Usage:** `sc4pac remove [options] [packages...]`

Remove packages that have been installed explicitly.

Afterwards, run `sc4pac update` for the changes to take effect.

**Examples:**
```sh
sc4pac remove --interactive               # Interactively select packages to remove.
sc4pac remove cyclone-boom:save-warning   # Remove package <group>:<package-name>.
```

**Options:**
- `-i, --interactive` Interactively select packages to remove


---
## search

**Usage:** `sc4pac search [options] [search text...]`

Search for the name of a package.
The results are ordered such that the best match is displayed at the bottom.

**Examples:**

```sh
sc4pac search "Pause border"
>>> (1) smp:yellow-pause-thingy-remover
>>>         Remove the yellow border from the UI when the game is paused

sc4pac search --threshold 20 "Pause border"    # Decrease threshold for more results.
>>> ...
```

You can search for a URL of a STEX entry or SC4Evermore download page to find any corresponding packages:

```sh
sc4pac search "https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/32812-save-warning/"
>>> ...

sc4pac search "https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/26-gameplay-mods/26-bsc-no-maxis"
>>> ...
```

**Options:**
- `--threshold <number>` Fuziness (0..100, default=80): Smaller numbers lead to more results.


---
## info

**Usage:** `sc4pac info [packages]`

Display more information about a package.

**Examples:**
```sh
sc4pac info cyclone-boom:save-warning
```

---
## list

**Usage:** `sc4pac list`

List all installed packages.


---
## variant reset

**Usage:** `sc4pac variant reset [options] [variants...]`

Select variants to reset in order to choose a different package variant.

For some packages you install, you can choose from a list of package variants that match your preferences. Your choices are stored in a configuration file.

After resetting a variant identifier, the next time you run `sc4pac update`, you will be asked to choose a new variant.

**Examples:**
```sh
sc4pac variant reset --interactive    # Interactively select variants to reset.
sc4pac variant reset "driveside"      # Reset the "driveside" variant.
```

**Options:**
- `-i, --interactive`  Interactively select variants to reset


---
## channel add

**Usage:** `sc4pac channel add [options] [channel-URL]`

Add a channel to fetch package metadata from.

**Examples:**
```sh
sc4pac channel add "https://memo33.github.io/sc4pac/channel/"
sc4pac channel add "file:///C:/absolute/path/to/local/channel/json/"
```

The URL in the examples above points to a directory structure consisting of JSON files created by the `sc4pac channel build` command.

For convenience, the channel URL may also point to a single YAML file instead, which skips the `sc4pac channel build` step.
This is mainly intended for testing purposes.

```sh
sc4pac channel add "file:///C:/Users/Dumbledore/Desktop/hogwarts-castle.yaml"
sc4pac channel add "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memo33/sc4pac/main/docs/hogwarts-castle.yaml"
```

---
## channel remove

**Usage:** `sc4pac channel remove [options] [URL-patterns]`

Select channels to remove.

**Examples:**
```sh
sc4pac channel remove --interactive     # Interactively select channels to remove.
sc4pac channel remove "github.com"      # Remove channel URLs containing "github.com".
```

**Options:**
- `-i, --interactive`  Interactively select channels to remove


---
## channel list

**Usage:** `sc4pac channel list`

List the channel URLs.

The first channel has the highest priority when resolving dependencies.


---
## channel build

**Usage:** `sc4pac channel build [options] [YAML-input-directories...]`

Build a channel locally by converting YAML files to JSON.

!> On Windows, this command may require special privileges to run. To resolve this, either
   run the command in a shell with administrator privileges, or
   use Java 13+ and enable
   [Windows Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development)
   on your device.

**Examples:**
```sh
sc4pac channel build --output "channel/json/" "channel/yaml/"
sc4pac channel build --label Local --metadata-source-url https://github.com/memo33/sc4pac/blob/main/src/yaml/ -o channel/json channel/yaml
```

Use the options `--label` and `--metadata-source-url` particularly for building publicly accessible channels.

**Options:**
- `-o, --output <dir>`         Output directory for JSON files
- `--label str`                Optional short channel name for display in the UI
- `--metadata-source-url url`  Optional base URL linking to the online YAML source files (for Edit Metadata button)


---
## extract

**Usage:** `sc4pac extract [options] [input-archive-file]`

Extract an archive file, such as ZIP, JAR, 7z, RAR or EXE installer files, using sc4pac semantics.
This is mainly useful when creating new metadata, as this provides a generic way for extracting multiple different archive formats.

This works best for archives containing only DBPF files.
Archives containing DLL files or Clickteam EXE installers may require some extra care.

**Examples:**
```sh
sc4pac extract --output out asset.zip                                           # extract all DBPF files
sc4pac extract -o out --include="\.SC4Model$" --include="\.SC4Desc$" asset.zip  # extract only Model and Desc files
sc4pac extract -o out --include="." --exclude='(?<!\.dll)$' asset.zip           # extract only DLL files
sc4pac extract -o out --clickteam-version 40 asset.zip                          # use only with Clickteam installers
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output <dir>`             Output directory for extracted files
- `--include <pattern>`            Include patterns
- `--exclude <pattern>`            Exclude patterns
- `--clickteam-version <version>`  Optional version for extracting Clickteam installers (40, 35, 30, 24, 20)


---
## test

**Usage:** `sc4pac test [options] [packages...]`

Test whether packages can be installed successfully.

This command downloads and installs a given package (temporarily), without any of its dependencies.
If the package has variants, many different variants are tested simultaneously (pairwise coverage of combinations).

Typical errors detected:

- some include/exclude patterns do not match any files (e.g. after updating to a new version of an asset)
- checksum errors
- extraction failures (e.g. if an asset is lacking a Clickteam installer designation)
- errors affecting some but not all variants

**Examples:**
```sh
sc4pac test memo:submenus-dll memo:3d-camera-dll
>>> (Pass) memo:submenus-dll 1.1.4-1
>>> (Pass) memo:3d-camera-dll 1.0.0-1
>>> ...
>>> All 2 packages installed successfully.

sc4pac test --quick jasoncw:cecil-hotel
>>> (Pass) jasoncw:cecil-hotel 1.0.0 [CAM=no, nightmode=standard]
>>> (Pass) jasoncw:cecil-hotel 1.0.0 [CAM=yes, nightmode=dark]
>>> ...
>>> All 1 packages installed successfully.
```

Use this command together with a locally built channel (see `sc4pac channel build`) in order to test your new or modified YAML files.

**Options:**
- `-o, --output <dir>`  Optional output directory to keep extracted files
- `-q, --quick`         Test fewer variants (only first and last)
- `-y, --yes`           Accept some default answers without asking, usually "yes"


---
## server

**Usage:** `sc4pac server [options]`

Start a local server to use the HTTP [API](api).

**Example:**
```sh
sc4pac server --profiles-dir profiles --indent 1
sc4pac server --profiles-dir profiles --web-app-dir build/web --launch-browser  # used by GUI web
sc4pac server --profiles-dir profiles --auto-shutdown --startup-tag [READY]     # used by GUI desktop
```

**Options:**
- `--port <number>`         (default: 51515)
- `--profiles-dir <path>`   directory containing the `sc4pac-profiles.json` file and profile sub-directories (platform-dependent default, see below), newly created if necessary
- `--web-app-dir <path>`    optional directory containing statically served webapp files (default: no static files)
- `--launch-browser`        automatically open the web browser when using the `--web-app-dir` option (default: `--launch-browser=false`)
- `--auto-shutdown`         automatically shut down the server when client closes connection to `/server.connect` (default: `--auto-shutdown=false`). This is used by the desktop GUI to ensure the port is cleared when the GUI exits.
- `--startup-tag <string>`  optional tag to print once server has started and is listening
- `--indent <number>`       indentation of JSON responses (default: -1, no indentation)

The `--profiles-dir` path defaults to the environment variable `SC4PAC_PROFILES_DIR` if it is set. Otherwise, it defaults to
- `%AppData%\io.github.memo33\sc4pac\config\profiles` on Windows,
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sc4pac/profiles` or `$HOME/.config/sc4pac/profiles` on Linux,
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/io.github.memo33.sc4pac/profiles` on macOS.
